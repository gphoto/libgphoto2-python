Compiling and installing from git clone
=======================================

If you are starting with a git clone of libgphoto2-python, you will
need a number of tools to initialize the build system:

   * autoconf
   * automake
   * libtool

Then you can run "autoreconf -is" in the top-level libgphoto2-python
directory, and after autoreconf is finished, you will have almost the
same files a released source tarball has.

If starting from an git clone and you intend to use the "python
setup.py" installation mechanism described below, you need to run
"./configure" once to create the setup.py script.


Compiling and installing from a released source tarball
=======================================================

Compiling and installing also requires a number of tools:

   * Python
   * Pyrex
   * C compiler

For simple cases where you don't need any special compile options, you
want to use the system's default libgphoto2 installation and you can
afford to install into the system's standard Python site-packages
directory, compiling and installing is as easy as:

   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

For more complicated build cases or out of soure tree builds, you can
use the "configure" mechanism with all the options it offers:

   $ ./configure --prefix=... PYREXC=... LIBGPHOTO2_CFLAGS=... LIBGPHOTO2_LIBS=...
   $ make
   $ make install       # possibly as root, depending on the prefix

For more details on the available options, run "./configure --help".
